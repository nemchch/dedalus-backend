# Hello! This is my Dedalus test task

## Back-end requirements
A backend part should be a Java server app with a RESTful API interface (Spring Boot is allowed) that would provide functionality of the Text Analyzer.

The Text Analyzer should also be refactored to be in a "good enough" state.

This basically means two things:
1. A developer should not be ashamed to give his code to a colleague for a code review
2. A company should not be afraid to sell this piece of software to another company


There is no right or wrong approach here.

The goal is to see how you handle things like testing, software design, integration of different technologies, vague requirements (like unspecified UI requirements or "good enough" concept), explanatory skills, ...

## What's implemented
1. Java Spring application with controller and service levels
2. Refactored algorithm 
3. Covered with unit tests and restassured

## Needed improvements
1. Configure application yml with different profiles (it doesn't need now for localhost application but will need for deployment and different test configuration)
2. Add error handling (to get validation without front-end level)

## Work log
1. Configure application 0,5 mh
2. Create controller and service levels 0,5 mh
3. Refactor algorithm 1 mh
4. Test coverage 1 mh

Total: 3 mh
